      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Ian! Currently, I'm an aspiring Software Developer
        currently majoring in Computer Science at Loyola Marymount University.
        I was born & raised in the small but homely state of Rhode Island. After
        deciding that I needed to explore some new places, meet new people, and
        try lots of different things, I moved to Los Angeles to further my education.
      </p>
      <p>
        At LMU, I've learned so many things and have been involved with all types of
        activities. I am a teaching assistant for the Keck Lab and LMU's Google
        CSSIx, the Secretary of LMU's Association for Computing Machinery, an
        active member of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternityâ€“just to name a few. I have
        also been involved with the Japanese Cultural Club Kyodai and the LMU
        Men's Volleyball Club Team.
      </p>
      <p>
        For programming experience, I've worked with a few different languages
        and technologies. I have programmed mainly in Java, but have also worked
        with Python, Javascript, HTML & CSS, and C. On top of that, I have used
        various technologies such as Github/Git, npm, React.js, and Google
        App Engine. I hope to use my knowledge and experience to develop intuitive
        applications that help and serve others.

<h1> PORTFOLIO </h1>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
